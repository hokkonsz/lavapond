Learning project for graphics programming using Vulkan with Ash in Rust.
Here I collected all the useful resources I used through my journey up until this point.
It may also be useful for others who have stumbled across it.

### VULKAN

I started with the most recommended [Vulkan tutorial](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/Drawing_a_triangle/Drawing/Rendering_and_presentation) by Alexander Overvoorde.
There is also a [licensed version](https://docs.vulkan.org/tutorial/latest/00_Introduction.html) of this on the officialy Khronos site,
but because I used the one created by Alexander I can't really compare the two.
Although the original has a [Rust implementation](https://github.com/bwasty/vulkan-tutorial-rs) I didn't really used it, because it uses Vulkano instead of Ash.
Speaking of Ash, the [exmaple project](https://github.com/ash-rs/ash/tree/master/ash-examples) in Ash was also very useful
and I would recommend it, if you have difficulties implementing the C++ code in Rust.

Understanding every aspect of the tutorial could also be problematic, especially if you are new to this field. Fortunately there are a plenty of resources on Vulkan.
For example there is a free video series about [Vulkan Essentials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tLwbj9qys18&list=PLmIqTlJ6KsE1Jx5HV4sd2jOe3V1KMHHgn) on the Computer Graphics at TU Wien channel, created by Johannes Unterguggenberger.
If at any steps you have difficulties with understanding a part of Vulkan or something is not clear, then I recommend to check the official [Vulkan Specification](https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/html/vkspec.html).
You can also find many [offical examples](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Samples) under the Khronos Group github.

### MATH / COMPUTER GRAPHICS

Math and especially matrices are playing the main role to thoroughly understand computer graphics.
For example I used the [matrices tutorial](https://www.opengl-tutorial.org/beginners-tutorials/tutorial-3-matrices/) on opengl-tutorial.org, to refresh my knowledge on the subject.
But I found the [Learning Modern 3D Graphics Programming](https://paroj.github.io/gltut/) by Jason L. McKesson also really helpful for
learning about general topics in computer graphics, which cannot be learned by only reading the Vulkan tutorial or Vulkan specifications.

### NEXT STEPS

After all of this you will have a base knowledge of how Vulkan and computer graphics works. If you want to step up your game, then there
are some other useful resources, like [Writing an efficient Vulkan renderer](https://zeux.io/2020/02/27/writing-an-efficient-vulkan-renderer/) by Arseny Kapoulkine.
For anyone who is interested in vector graphics there is [Vector graphics on GPU](https://gasiulis.name/vector-graphics-on-gpu/) by Aurimas Gasiulis.
I also found interesenting of the [Drawing Antialiased Lines with OpenGL](https://blog.mapbox.com/drawing-antialiased-lines-with-opengl-8766f34192dc) by Konstantin KÃ¤fer.
Maybe reading these will put an idea in your head about where to go next.

### ABOUT THE PROJECT

Here is a short introduction to the project through the [**Physics System**](https://github.com/hokkonsz/lavapond/tree/main/examples/physics_app) example.
This is still only a WIP and wannabe physics system, where I am trying to simulate the collision of different objects.

```cargo run --example physics_app```

![app_run](https://github.com/hokkonsz/lavapond/tree/master/res/img/app_run.png)

Calling app::run() will create a window and an event loop via the [winit](https://github.com/rust-windowing/winit) crate, where the latter handles the user inputs and issues the draw calls.
When the main events are cleared we update the physics system, create a draw pool and submit a draw request
to the renderer.

1. [Syncronization](https://www.khronos.org/blog/understanding-vulkan-synchronization)
2. [Clear & Begin Command Buffer ( After All Commands Recorded End )](https://vkguide.dev/docs/chapter-1/vulkan_command_flow/)
3. [Begin Render Pass ( After All Drawing Commands Recorded End Pass )](https://developer.samsung.com/galaxy-gamedev/resources/articles/renderpasses.html)
4. Record Commands: Binding Data (eg. Pipeline, Vertex Buffer, ...), Set Scissor & Viewport, Drawing
5. [Submit Command Buffer To Queue + Present Queue](https://docs.vulkan.org/guide/latest/queues.html)
